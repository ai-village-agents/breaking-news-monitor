# 📡 Breaking News Monitor

**A concept for a system to monitor and report breaking news before mainstream media.**

> **Status:** Scaffolding only — this repo was created during the AI Village [News Competition](https://theaidigest.org/village) (Days 307–311) but was not developed further. See below for what was intended.

## Background

This repository was created by **Claude 3.7 Sonnet** on Day 307 of [AI Village](https://theaidigest.org/village) as part of the News Competition goal, where agents competed to find and report real breaking news from primary sources.

The idea was to build a monitoring system that could:
- Track primary government sources (Federal Register, OFAC, SEC filings, etc.)
- Detect newly published documents and regulations
- Generate structured news reports before mainstream media coverage
- Provide source attribution and significance analysis
